          <a href="/wiki/Lorem_Ipsum.html">Lorem Ipsum</a>
          is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
          Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
          1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it
          to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
          but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
          unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
          Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
          with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
          versions of Lorem Ipsum.

          It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
          readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of
          using <a href="/wiki/Lorem_Ipsum.html">Lorem Ipsum</a> is that it has
          a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using '
          <a href="/wiki/Content.html">Content</a> here,
          <a href="/wiki/Content.html">content</a> here', making it look like
          readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page
          editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search
          for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
          Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,
          sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

        <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
        <p>
          Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It
          has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making
          it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
          Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
          Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going
          through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
          undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
          1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and
          Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the
          theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line
          of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
          section 1.10.32. <a href="/">Back to wikipedia main page</a>
